    "# Final Project\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is to complete some basic tasks of Data Science programming. I am doing this project using Python and markdown codes on the Jupyterlite Notebook platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Science languages\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python: It's a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that focuses on code readability.\n",
    "- R: It's a programming language and free software environment for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing.\n",
    "- SQL: It's a standard language for managing and manipulating databases.\n",
    "- Julia: It's a high-level, high-performance dynamic programming language for technical computing, with syntax that is familiar to users of other technical computing environments.\n",
    "- Scala: It's a strong static type of programming language and it's influenced by the Java programming language.\n",
    "- MATLAB: It's a high-performance language for technical computing. It integrates computation, visualization, and programming in an easy-to-use environment where problems and solutions are expressed in common mathematical notation.\n",
    "- SAS: It's a software suite developed by SAS Institute for advanced analytics, multivariate analyses, business intelligence, data management, and predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Science libraries\n",
    "\n",
    "- NumPy: It provides support for arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these elements.\n",
    "- SciPy: Built on top of NumPy, it provides additional functionality compared to NumPy.\n",
    "- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures and functions needed to manipulate structured data.\n",
    "- Matplotlib: It's a plotting library, and it is designed to work with the broader SciPy stack.\n",
    "- Seaborn: This is a Python visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.\n",
    "- Plotly: It's a graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs online.\n",
    "- Bokeh: It's a Python interactive visualization library that targets modern web browsers for presentation.\n",
    "- Statsmodels: It provides functions for the estimation of many different statistical models, as well as for conducting statistical tests and statistical data exploration.\n",
    "- Scikit-learn: Built on NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib, this library contains a lot of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- TensorFlow: It's a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks, and it's a symbolic math library used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.\n",
    "- PyTorch: Similar to TensorFlow, it's a machine learning library for Python, based on Torch, used for applications such as natural language processing.\n",
    "- Keras: It's a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano.\n",

    "## Arithmetic expression examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Arithmetic expressions are combinations of numbers, variables and operators that are calculated to produce a result. Here are some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Addition: `3 + 2` results in `5`\n",
    "- Subtraction: `3 - 2` results in `1`\n",
    "- Multiplication: `3 * 2` results in `6`\n",
    "- Division: `3 / 2` results in `1.5`\n",
    "- Exponentiation: `3 ** 2` results in `9`\n",
    "- Modulus: `3 % 2` results in `1`\n",
    "- Floor Division: `3 // 2` results in `1`"
